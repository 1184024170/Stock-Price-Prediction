# Stock-Price-Prediction
Predicting stock price using historical data of a company, using Neural networks (LSTM).

This project includes python programs to show Keras LSTM can be used to predict future stock prices for a company using it's
historical stock price data. 
You can also find sample programs on how to fine tune Hyperprameters of LSTM (or any Neural Network for that matter).

Here is the final result : (although performance can be further improved by playing around with the parameters even more)
